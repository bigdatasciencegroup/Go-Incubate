Adaickalavan received B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2010 and 2014, respectively. His Ph.D. was in Statistical Signal Processing and Adaptive Filter Theory, and was applied to the field of Optical Communication <a href="/portfolio/cwdaml_and_adaptivecwda/">receiver design</a>. His Ph.D. advisors were [Prof. Kam Pooi Yuen](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elekampy/) and [Prof. Kim Hoon](http://psrl.kaist.ac.kr/psrl_people.html).

From 2014 to 2017, he was a Software Engineer - Statistical Signal Processing, at NXP Semiconductors Singapore, where he (i) lead the Type-B NFC ASK/PSK digital baseband receiver design and (ii) was engaged in traffic sign recognition tasks using convolutional neural networks for self driving car application. Since 2017, he has been a Senior Software Engineer - Golang & Kafka, with Panasonic Singapore, working on (i) intelligent driver distraction state modeling and prediction via deep learning from face and eye sensor data, and (ii) end-to-end system development for facial emotion recognition.

His research interest includes signal processing, simulation & modeling, distributed real-time computation, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. He has worked on problems in the fields of object/parameter tracking, pattern classification, image recognition, and real-time time-series data. Strong in mathematical modelling, stochastic processes, optimization theory, algorithm development, and bench-top experimental skills.

Dr. Adaickalavan is a member of [Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers - IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/index.html). He is an ad-hoc reviewer for (i) [Optics Express - Optical Society of America](http://www.osa.org/en-us/home/), (ii) [Photonics Technology Letters - IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=68), and (iii) [Electronic Letters - IET](http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/el).
