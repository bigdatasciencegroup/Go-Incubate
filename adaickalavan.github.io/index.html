<p>Welcome to my personal site. Here, I delve into the world of statistical signal processing, machine learning, blockchain, and pretty much about anything else which involves intelligence. In truth, machine learning spawned from the field of statistics and stochastic processes. Hence, a good grasp of the underlying mathematics and algorithms are necessary to excel in successfully automating intelligence to solve problems - a.k.a. machine learning!</p>

<p>Feel free to explore my site.</p> 
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="/portfolio/">portfolio</a> tab contains several of my works on statistical signal processing, machine learning, my doctoral endeavour, and GO projects.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/year-archive/">posts</a> tab contain standalone posts on specific topics.</li> 
  <li>A quick self-learning guide for machine learning can be found in my post <a href="/guides/online-courses-in-machine-learning/">here</a>.</li>
