# High performance computing - C++, OpenMP, and MPI

## OpenMP - Tim Mattson
We provide the code solutions to C++ and OpenMP coding exercises from the Intro to OpenMP by Tim Mattson, Intel Corp, course. Watch the course [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE-xN4Bf8XI&list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG) and read the course [notes](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/Intro_To_OpenMP_Mattson.pdf).

For easy reference, each code solution is named according to the slide on which they appear in the course [notes](https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/Intro_To_OpenMP_Mattson.pdf).
